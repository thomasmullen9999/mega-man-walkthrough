				<p>This page details the regular enemies that you'll find dotted in the different levels throughout the game. There are 19 in total mentioned here. 
				If you're looking for information on how to defeat bosses, check their respective level in the main walkthrough and scroll down to the bottom of
				the page for boss guides; this page is specifically for the more common, lower-level enemies. The enemies are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
		
				<p>Here is an example of what the attributes in each green box mean. Consider it a template for the actual enemy files below.</p>
				
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<h2>Enemy's Name</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> These are some of the other names given to the enemy in official English translations of the game (eg. in remakes/re-releases).</li>

						</ul>	
				</div>
				
		
				<p>Thanks to the Mega Man Legacy Collection for detailing the HP, Attack and Weakness stats for me so I didn't have to spend a <em>lot</em> of time 
				finding them myself by playing the game. Without further ado...</p>
				
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/adheringsuzy.png" alt="Adhering Suzy artwork">
					<h2>Adhering Suzy</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Octopus Battery, Octo Battery</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage, Ice Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 2 &amp; 3</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 05</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 04</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Thunder Beam</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These things always travel in a straight line, either vertically or horizontally. Watch their movements from nearby before going 
							in to attack, so you know where you'll be safe to shoot them from.</li>
						</ul>	
				</div>
				
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/bigeye.png" alt="Big Eye artwork">
					<h2>Big Eye</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Guts Man's stage, Cut Man's stage, Elec Man's stage, Ice Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 1</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 20</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 10</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Super Arm</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> You'll often see these at the end of a level before the boss (or see three together at the start of the first Wily stage). 
							They take a lot of shots to kill regardless of which weapon you use and you won't have much time as they jump towards you quickly. Instead of 
							defeating it, use the Ice Slasher to freeze it in midair and slip on under. This is probably the most annoying and tricky regular enemy.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/blaster.png" alt="Blaster artwork">
					<h2>Blaster</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Beak</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 2</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> Blasters are small cannon-guns stuck to walls that shoot laser spheres in 4 directions. They shoot in the same pattern 
							every time so you should watch them from afar if possible to see where their shots are going to land, then stand in a safe place. Shoot them 
							where their cannon opens up and they become vulnerable.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/bombombomb.png" alt="Bombombomb artwork">
					<h2>Bombombomb</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Bombomb</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Bomb Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 2</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 00</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These are only seen for short periods in the levels they appear in. They are invincible so don't bother shooting them and just 
							try to avoid the bits of shrapnel they explode into. For more detail on dealing with these guys, check the walkthrough section for Bomb Man's stage.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/bunbyheli.png" alt="Bunby Heli artwork">
					<h2>Bunby Heli</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Blader</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Guts Man's stage, Cut Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 2</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These guys are very annoying and swoop down rapidly when they're above you. Either run past them and possibly take a little damage or 
							jump and shoot them at the precise moment they start to come down. The Thunder Beam is effective as it fires up above you as well as straight ahead.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
				
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/changkey.png" alt="Changkey artwork">
					<h2>Changkey</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Tackle Fire</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Fire Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 02</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These hotheads emerge suddenly from pits in sets of three. Be careful they don't burn you as you jump over the pits, and then keep an eye
							to the sky as they'll then descend from above and float down in different paths.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
				
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/crazyrazy.png" alt="Crazy Razy artwork">
					<h2>Crazy Razy</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Ice Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Thunder Beam</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These only appear near the beginning of Ice Man's stage. To defeat them, simply shoot their head once. If you shoot their legs, their head 
							will detach and start attacking you like an large Bunby Heli; this can be really annoying.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/footholder.png" alt="Foot Holder artwork">
					<h2>Foot Holder</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Ice Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 1</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 00</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> Foot Holders are more like stage hazards than enemies, as you can't defeat them but they can hurt you by shooting out small beams from their sides. You need to 
							use them as platforms to cross a bottomless pit or a gorge of spikes. Their erratic and unpredictable movements make them annoying to jump between, so it may be 
							better to use the Magnet Beam (if you have it) to cross the pits in the two areas where Foot Holders are situated.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/gabyoall.png" alt="Gabyoall artwork">
					<h2>Gabyoall</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Gabyool, Spine</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Elec Man's stage, Ice Man's stage, Fire Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Thunder Beam</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These things look like spike traps from Zelda, and act in a very similar way. They move back and forth along the floor, and will speed up when you are standing near 
							them. They'll often knock you off ledges and are invincible to the Mega Buster, so use the Thunder Beam or Rolling Cutter to destroy and make things much easier.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/kamadoma.png" alt="Kamadoma artwork">
					<h2>Kamadoma</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Flea</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage, Elec Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 1</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 02</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> Kamadomas jump around very eagerly like robotic crickets. They're very simple enemies and, although they can sometimes be pests that are hard to hit, they die from one 
							shot from the Mega Buster.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/killerbomb.png" alt="Killer Bomb artwork">
					<h2>Killer Bomb</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Killer Bullet</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Fire Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 1, Wily's Fortress 3</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> The long lost brother of Bullet Bill from Mario games? They'll fly towards you in a wave-shaped pattern. Try to shoot them from afar as they die in only one shot but 
							explode upon being hit, potentially damaging you.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/mambu.png" alt="Mambu artwork">
					<h2>Mambu</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Flying Shell</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage, Bomb Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These enemies release 8 beam shots in a circle around them that can be tricky to dodge depending on where they are in the level. They do die in only one shot but it 
							may be safer to just run past them, especially if they're above a spike pit.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/metall.png" alt="Metall artwork">
					<h2>Metall</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Met</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Gut Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> Although they appear in only one stage, I would say these are the Goombas of this game, and the Mega Man series in general. One shot will kill them, and 
							their three shots are easy to dodge. Just fire when it lifts up its helmet.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/pepe.png" alt="Pepe artwork">
					<h2>Pepe</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Peng</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Ice Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 3</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 01</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 04</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> They're very simple to kill but their wavy movements make them annoying to hit. Definitely not hard enemies by any stretch, but they're a pain if they knock 
							you into a spike pit. Use the Ice Slasher to freeze them in midair?</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/pickelman.png" alt="Pickelman artwork">
					<h2>Pickelman</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Picket Man</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Guts Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 10</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Fire Storm</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These guys take quite a few hits. What you want to do is wait until they lift their shield, then fire at them rapidly and move in slowly to avoid their 
							raining pickaxes that they throw at you. Hopefully you can kill them before you run into them with this method. However, use Fire Storm or Hyper Bomb if you have them 
							because they kill Pickelmen in one hit.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/screwdriver.png" alt="Screw Driver artwork">
					<h2>Screw Driver</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> Screw Bomber</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage, Fire Man's stage, Wily's Fortress 2, Wily's Fortress 3, Wily's Fortress 4</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 03</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 02</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Thunder Beam</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> One of the most common enemies in the game. They can be found on both the floor and ceiling, and when they emerge they will shoot 5 beams that spread 
							and travel in different directions. They're annoying when there are a lot of them (particularly in the last level) but watch for where their shots land and you'll 
							be fine.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/sniperjoe.png" alt="Sniper Joe artwork">
					<h2>Sniper Joe</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Bomb Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 10</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 04</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Hyper Bomb</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> The first robot in the 'Joe' series that come in lots of different variations throughout the series. These guys are similar to the Pickelmen, 
							except they shoot you with a gun arm just like Mega Man's. They'll jump around a lot too.  Shoot at them when they lift their shields and have patience. 
							Fun fact: Sniper Joe was created by Dr Light and is based on the design of Proto Man, a popular recurring character who makes his debut in Mega Man 3.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/supercutter.png" alt="Super Cutter artwork">
					<h2>Super Cutter</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>
							<li><b>Appears in:</b> Cut Man's stage</li>
							<li><b>HP:</b> 05</li>
							<li><b>Attack:</b> 04</li>
							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Hyper Bomb</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> These things look like white versions of Pac-Man but they're actually sentient versions of Cut Man's weapon. They only appear in 
							two parts of Cut Man's stage and all they do is jump out of silver cages at you. They're indestructible to most weapons but all you need to do is move right past their cages 
							without stopping; they pose no real threat.</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
		
		
				<div class="enemy">
					<img src="images/enemies/watcher.png" alt="Watcher artwork">
					<h2>Watcher</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Also known as:</b> N/A</li>

							<li><b>Weakness:</b> Mega Buster</li>
							<li><b>Difficulty:</b> &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2605; &#x2606; &#x2606;</li>
							<li><b>Description:</b> Watchers will move onto the screen in groups from above or below and shoot out electric beams from their eyes when you're in front of them. These beams can 
							be a major hindrance if they knock you off a ladder and cause you to fall to the screen below. Shoot left/right at them as soon as they're parallel to you (one hit kills them).</li>
