# Mega Man Walkthrough Site

By Thomas Mullen

## Intro

This website was created using only vanilla HTML5 and CSS to demonstrate understanding of accessibility and styling, as well as to consolidate my knowledge of front-end design. The site is a walkthrough for the original Mega Man game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. I do not own any of the images or content referenced on this site and everything displayed here is for informative and demonstrative purposes only.

Also featured on the site is an 'Enemy Guide' which has information on all of the various enemies that the player can encounter in the game.

## Accessibility and Usability

Below is a list of decisions that were made regarding the design of the site, when considering accessiblity practices.

*	For the main paragraph content, I used a font-size that is large enough to read for people with poor eyesight, but not too large as to look unprofessional or make the page extremely long.

*	Since the main walkthrough section is quite long, I implemented a simple and interactive table of contents that allows the user to navigate between different levels easily. 

* When the user hovers over one of the elements in either the main navigation menu or the walkthrough’s table of contents, that element will change colour to white. Otherwise, the default colour is blue, but will be purple if the user has previously visited that page.

* The page that the user is currently on will be listed in red in the table of contents/navigation menu. This helps them to easily get to different sections without accidentally choosing the page that they are already on.

* On the Enemy Guide page, I included an example template near the top of the page that explains what each attribute in the individual enemy files refers to. This is simpler than explaining what each attribute means in every single enemy file. 

*	In the ‘Controls’ section of the Getting Started part of the walkthrough, I included a table which shows the game’s controls for many different consoles. This table format makes it easy for the user to quickly find which button they should press for a certain action, depending which console they’re playing the game on.

*	I included in-game screenshots at points where it may be hard to understand exactly what I’m explaining through text alone, such as ‘suzyjump.jpeg’ in Cut Man’s Stage, and ‘shrapnelavoid.jpeg’ in Bomb Man’s Stage.

* At the bottom of each page in the walkthrough, in the footer, I included links to the previous and next parts. This makes it easy to continue to the next section without having to scroll back up to the table of contents.

* I enclosed important parts of the text in <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em> tags when appropriate, to indicate to screen readers when a part of the text should be emphasised. I used normal bold tags for when emphasis is not necessary. 

* I applied various attributes in Media Queries to ensure that the website would function well on different devices and different window sizes.
